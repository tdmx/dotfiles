# NOTE: .gitignore patterns are evaluated in order. Therefore, it's important
# to be mindful of the order of entries in this file.
#
# In particular, these first two lines should always be at the top of this file
# and in this order.
#
# - The first line tells git to ignore all paths.
# - The second line tells git to make an exception for "hidden" paths (paths starting with '.', i.e. "dotfiles")
# - The third line ensures that the contents of hidden directories are not ignored
#
# These two lines alone clear away most of the unwanted items cluttering the
# git status output.
